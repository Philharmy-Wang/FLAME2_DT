## 1. Introduction

FLAME2-DT is an enhanced version of the FLAME2 dataset, specifically designed for multi-modal forest fire detection research. The dataset features paired RGB-thermal infrared images captured by a Mavic 2 Enterprise Advanced UAV system, with comprehensive pixel-level annotations for both fire and smoke regions. This dataset aims to address the limitations in the original FLAME2 dataset, including missing annotations, resolution constraints, and spatial registration biases.

Key findings from statistical analysis:

1. **Scale Characteristics**
   * Fire: ~80% of bounding boxes occupy <5% of image area (small-scale, discrete distribution)
   * Smoke: >60% of bounding boxes occupy >12% of image area (large-scale, continuous distribution)

2. **Spatial Distribution**
   * Fire: Multi-centered, scattered pattern
   * Smoke: Relatively dispersed distribution of center points

## 3. Dataset Development

### Data Collection
* Equipment: Mavic 2 Enterprise Advanced UAV dual-camera system
* Resolution: 640Ã—512 pixels (both RGB and thermal IR)
* Processing: Feature point matching and spatial transformation consistency analysis

### Annotation Protocol
* Multi-expert cross-validation strategy
* Pixel-level precise labeling
* RGB Images: 
  - 2,496 fire bounding boxes
  - 4,404 smoke bounding boxes
* Thermal IR Images:
  - 27,117 fire bounding boxes
  - No smoke annotations (due to thermal imaging limitations)
